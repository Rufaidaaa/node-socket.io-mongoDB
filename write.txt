Hi @Rufaidaaa,

You recently used a password to access the repository at Rufaidaaa/node-socket.io-mongoDB with git using git/2.25.1.windows.1.

Basic authentication using a password to Git is deprecated and will soon no longer work. Visit https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/ for more information around suggested workarounds and removal dates.

Thanks,
The GitHub Team
